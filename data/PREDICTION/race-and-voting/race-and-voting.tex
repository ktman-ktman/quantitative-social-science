For this problem set, we will analyze data from the following article:

Fraga, Bernard. (2015)
\href{http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ajps.12172}{``Candidates or Districts?
Reevaluating the Role of Race in Voter Turnout,''} \emph{American
Journal of Political Science}, Vol. 60, No. 1, pp.~97--122.

Fraga assesses the theory that minority voters are more likely to vote
in elections featuring co-ethnic candidates. He shows that the
association between minority voter turnout and co-ethnic candidates
disappears once we take into account district-level racial composition.
In particular, he demonstrates that in districts where blacks make up a
greater share of the voting-age population, blacks in that district are
more likely to vote in elections \emph{regardless} of candidate race.
Although the main analyses he carries out are a bit more complicated
than what we cover in \emph{QSS}, we can replicate his substantive
findings using the multiple regression approach we've learned.

A description of the variables is listed below:

\subsection{Question 1}\label{question-1}

Fraga analyzes turnout data for four different racial and ethnic groups,
but for this analysis we will focus on the data for black voters. Load
\texttt{blackturnout.csv}. Which years are included in the dataset? How
many different states are included in the dataset?

\subsection{Question 2}\label{question-2}

Create a boxplot that compares turnout in elections with and without a
co-ethnic candidate. Be sure to use informative labels. Interpret the
resulting graph.

\subsection{Question 3}\label{question-3}

Run a linear regression with black turnout as your outcome variable and
candidate co-ethnicity as your predictor. Report the coefficient on your
predictor and the intercept. Interpret these coefficients. Do not merely
comment on the direction of the association (i.e., whether the slope is
positive or negative). Explain what the value of the coefficients mean
in terms of the units in which each variable is measured. Based on these
coefficients, what would you conclude about blacks voter turnout and
co-ethnic candidates?

\subsection{Question 4}\label{question-4}

You decide to investigate the results of the previous question a bit
more carefully because the elections with co-ethnic candidates may
differ from the elections without co-ethnic candidates in other ways.
Create a scatter plot where the x-axis is the proportion of co-ethnic
voting-age population and the y-axis is black voter turnout. Color your
points according to candidate co-ethnicity. That is, make the points for
elections featuring co-ethnic candidates one color, and make the points
for elections featuring no co-ethnic candidates a different color.
Interpret the graph.

\subsection{Question 5}\label{question-5}

Run a linear regression with black turnout as your outcome variable and
with candidate co-ethnicity and co-ethnic voting-age population as your
predictors. Report the coefficients, including the intercept. Interpret
the coefficients on the two predictors, ignoring the intercept for now
(you will interpret the intercept in the next question). Explain what
each coefficient represents in terms of the units of the relevant
variables.

\subsection{Question 6}\label{question-6}

Now interpret the intercept from the regression model with two
predictors. Is this intercept a substantively important or interesting
quantity? Why or why not?

\subsection{Question 7}\label{question-7}

Based on the regression model with one predictor, what do you conclude
about the relationship between co-ethnic candidates and black voter
turnout? Based on the regression model with two predictors, what do you
conclude about the relationshop between co-ethnic candidates and black
voter turnout? Please ignore issues of statistical significance for this
question given that it will be covered in Chapter 7 of \emph{QSS}.
