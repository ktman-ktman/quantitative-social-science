\maketitle


The U.S. president is elected by the electoral college -- 538 electors
corresponding to 435 members of congress, 100 senators, and 3 additional
electors allocated to Washington D.C.. The number of electoral votes
allocated to each state is equal to the size of its congressional
delegation. And most states cast all their electoral votes for the
candidate receiving a plurality of the state's votes in the general
election (the \emph{winner-takes-all} rule). Nebraska and Maine are the
only two exceptions. These states allocate two electoral votes to the
candidate receiving a plurality of the state's votes, and each of their
remaining electoral votes go to the candidate receiving a plurality of
votes within each of the states' congressional districts. But these are
small and relatively homogeneous states. Maine has never actually split
its electoral votes and Nebraska did it only once, casting a vote for
Obama in 2008.

A candidate must receive a simple majority of electoral college votes
(270 votes) to be elected. But, as we have seen in 2000, it is possible
for a candidate to win the election without receiving a plurality of the
popular vote. In today's precept we will analyze state-level polls
downloaded from the Huffington Post's Pollster
(\url{http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/polls}) and 3
additional polls for Washington D.C. available at
(\url{http://www.electoral-vote.com/evp2016/Pres/pres_polls.txt}) to
predict the outcomes of the 2016 presidential election. We will predict
the distribution of electoral college votes according to the
\emph{winner-takes-all} rule and using only the 3 most recent polls in
each state and examine how this distribution changed over time, starting
at 90 days before the election.

The dataset we will be using this week (\texttt{polls2016.csv}) has 905
observations, each representing a different poll, and includes the
following 7 variables:

\subsection{Question 1}\label{question-1}

We will begin by restricting our poll data to the 3 most recent polls in
each state and computing the average support for each candidate by
state. Create a scatterplot showing support for Clinton vs.~support for
Trump. Use state abbreviations to plot the results. Briefly interpret
the results.

\textbf{Hint:} To do this see the code in Section 4.1.3 of QSS. The only
difference is that you will have to sort the polls by the
\texttt{days\_to\_election} variable within each state. Use the
\texttt{sort()} function to sort the polls from the latest to the
oldest. When the \texttt{index.return} argument is set to \texttt{TRUE},
this function will return the ordering index vector, which can be used
to extract the 3 most recent polls for each state.

\subsection{Question 2}\label{question-2}

Based on the average support you calculated for Clinton and Trump,
predict the winner of each state and allocate the corresponding
electoral college votes to the predicted winner. While two states, Maine
and Nebraska, do not apply the \emph{winner-takes-all} rule to allocate
their electoral votes, for the sake of simplicity, we will apply this
rule uniformly across these states as well. If the support for the two
candidates in a given state is identical, split the state's electoral
votes. Who do you predict will win the election? How many electoral
college votes do you predict each candidate will receive?

\subsection{Question 3}\label{question-3}

Let's examine how our predictions may have differed if we had used only
polls based on \emph{likely voters}. Since we have fewer polls that are
based on likely voters, for each state compute the average of the most
recent poll (based on the \texttt{days\_to\_election} variable) and
those conducted within 30 days from it. In addition, assume that Clinton
will win Washington DC. How does the result change when compared to
Question 2? Repeat the question but this time using the polls based on
\emph{registered voters}. Briefly interpret the results.

\subsection{Question 4}\label{question-4}

Finally, we examine how poll predictions have changed over the past few
weeks. Starting at 60 days before the election, and for each day, repeat
the same analysis as the one conducted for Question 1. That is, for each
day, we take the 3 latest polls (or fewer if only one or two is
available) for each state and compute the average support separately for
Clinton and Trump within each state. We then allocate the electoral
votes of that state based on its predicted winner. Use a time series
plot to present the predicted total number of electoral votes for each
candidate. Add the winning line, i.e., an absolute majority of 270
votes, as a horizontal line. Briefly describe the results.

\textbf{Hint:} You may want to create a nested loop, in which an outer
loop is for each day, starting 60 days before the election and stopping
on the day of the most recent poll, and an inner loop is used to
calculate support for each candidate by state using the 3 most recent
polls on any given day.
