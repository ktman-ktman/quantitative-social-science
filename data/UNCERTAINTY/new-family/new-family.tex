\maketitle


Are children of parents who have same-sex relationships different? The
New Family Structures Study (NFSS) sampled American young adults (aged
18-39) who were raised in various types of family arrangements. A
sociologist, Mark Regnerus, published the debut article analyzing data
from the NFSS in 2012 and concluded that young adults raised by a parent
who had a same-sex romantic relationship fared worse on a majority of 40
different outcomes, compared to six other family-of-origin types.

The controversial initial findings from the study were soon revisited
and challenged by various scholars, including Cheng and Powell (2015)
and Rosenfeld (2015). This controversy was at the heart of evidence
presented in the recent Supreme Court case that struck down the Defense
of Marriage Act and legalized gay marriage across the US. In 2015, the
American Sociological Association filed an amicus brief with the Supreme
Court stating that the initial study by Regnerus in 2012 ``cannot be
used to argue that children of same-sex parents fare worse than children
of different-sex parents'' because ``the paper never actually studied
children raised by same-sex parents.'' This exercise is adapted from the
initial study, along with two response papers:

  Account}.'' \emph{Sociological Science}, 2, pp.~478-501.
\end{itemize}

To simplify the analysis, we focus on three mutually exclusive groups of
household settings, used in the original study by Regnerus (we use the
same names that Regnerus did in his original study). These are already
coded and available in the data set: \texttt{ibf} if the respondent
lived with mother and father from age 0 to 18 and their parents are
still married at the time of the survey (referred to as ``intact
biological families''); \texttt{lm} if the respondent's mother had a
same-sex romantic relationship; \texttt{gd} if the respondent's father
had a same-sex romantic relationship; and \texttt{other} if the
respondent belongs to neither the \texttt{ibf} nor same-sex families.

We focus mainly on two outcomes of interest: 1) level of depression of
the respondent, measured by the CES-D depression index and 2) whether
the respondent is currently on public assistance. The data set is the
file \texttt{nfss.csv}. Variables in this data set are described below:

\subsection{Question 1}\label{question-1}

We begin by comparing respondents in intact biological families
(\texttt{ibf}) with those whose mother had a same-sex relationship
(\texttt{lm}), as Regnerus did in his original study.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\item
  What is the mean level of depression, respectively, for respondents in
  \texttt{ibf} versus \texttt{lm} families? Construct a 95\% confidence
  interval around each estimate. Note that depression measure is missing
  for some respondents, which need to be removed before computing its
  mean.
\item
  We want to examine if young adults growing up in \texttt{lm} families
  have different levels of depression from those growing up in
  \texttt{ibf}. Conduct a two-sided hypothesis test, using 5\% as the
  significance level. Make sure to state your null hypothesis and
  alternative hypothesis explicitly.
\item
  Can we claim that having a mother who had a same-sex relationship
  causes young adult children to be more depressed? Why or why not?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Question 2}\label{question-2}

Now we use regression models to estimate the difference in depression
levels among young adults raised in different family arrangements.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\item
  Run a linear regression to estimate the difference in depression level
  among the four groups (\texttt{lm}, \texttt{gd}, \texttt{ibf},
  \texttt{other}). Use \texttt{ibf} as the reference group. \emph{Based
  on the results from the regression}: What is the estimated difference
  in depression level between \texttt{lm} and \texttt{ibf}? How does it
  compare to your finding in Question 1a? What is the estimated average
  depression level among those in \texttt{ibf}? How does it compare to
  your finding in Question 1a? What is the estimated average depression
  level among young adults in \texttt{gd}?
\item
  Following Regnerus (2012), add several variables to the regression
  model in part a, including age, gender, mother's education, race
  (non-Hispanic white or not), and perceived family of origin income.
  Interpret the coefficients on \texttt{lm}, \texttt{gd} and
  \texttt{other} in relation to the scale of the outcome variable. Are
  these coefficients different from your results in part a? Why?
\item
  What is the predicted depression level for a 28-year old, non-Hispanic
  white, male respondent growing up in \texttt{ibf} and whose mother had
  ``some college'' education and whose perceived family-of-origin income
  is 40 to 75k? What about a person with the same characteristics but
  from an \texttt{other} family group?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Question 3}\label{question-3}

Regnerus describes the results of this study as showing that young
adults ``\emph{raised by}'' parents in same-sex relationships fare
differently from other young adults. Cheng and Powell (2015) used
calendar data that was included in the original NFSS study but not used
in the Regnerus paper to examine how many years the young adults
categorized in \texttt{lm} and \texttt{gd} groups actually lived with
their parent and the parent's same-sex partner from age 0 to 18. This
information is recorded by the variable \texttt{ytogether} in the data
set provided. Note: the variable is missing for young adults in
\texttt{ibf} and \texttt{other} because they do not have a parent with
same-sex relationship.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\item
  Create two histograms, one for \texttt{lm} and the other for
  \texttt{gd}, to show the distribution of \texttt{ytogether} for each
  group. Make sure to set the bin width to 1 year. Interpret the
  histograms. Does your finding strengthen or weaken Regnerus' claim
  that his results show that children raised by same-sex parents are
  different? Justify your answer.
\item
  Do young adults in \texttt{lm} families who actually lived with the
  same-sex couple have different levels of depression from those growing
  up in \texttt{ibf}? Remove young adults who have never lived with
  their mother and her same-sex partner from the \texttt{lm} group. Then
  repeat the analysis in Question 1b. Do your conclusions change?
\item
  Suppose that the population average difference in depression scale is
  0.2 between two populations, and that this difference has a standard
  deviation of one. Using the correct sample sizes for the variables
  that you used in part b (those in the \texttt{lm} group who actually
  lived with their parent's same-sex partner and those in the
  \texttt{ibf} group), compute the probability of failing to reject the
  null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is false (Type II error). To
  answer this question, you may use a Monte Carlo simulation or solve it
  analytically. What is the implication of your result for your
  conclusion in part b? \emph{Hint: To run a Monte Carlo simulation,
  suppose data for each group are generated from a normal distribution,
  one with mean 0 and standard deviation 1, and the other with mean 0.2
  and standard deviation 1. How many times out of your total number of
  simulation do you fail to reject the null hypothesis?}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Question 4}\label{question-4}

Rosenfeld (2015) challenged the findings from Regnerus by showing that
family instability--adult household members moving into and out of the
child's household--explains most of the negative outcomes that had been
attributed to same-sex parents. In the data set, we have included
\texttt{ftransition} variable which was used by Rosenfeld to measure
number of family transitions. For this question we will focus on a
different outcome: the proportion of respondents on welfare.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\item
  Compute the mean number of family transitions of each group
  (\texttt{lm}, \texttt{gd}, \texttt{other}, \texttt{ibf}). Further
  examine the data by using box plots. Describe your findings. According
  to your findings, do you think Intact Biological Families
  (\texttt{ibf}) is the best comparison group for studying the effect of
  having a parent who had same-sex relationship? Why or why not?
\item
  Restrict the sample to young adults with stable families (0 family
  transitions) only. Combine the \texttt{gd} and \texttt{lm} groups into
  one group \texttt{ss} for young adults with at least one parent who
  had a same-sex relationship. What is the proportion on public
  assistance, respectively, among those in \texttt{ibf} vs. \texttt{ss}
  families? Is the proportion on public assistance significantly
  different between the two groups? Conduct a two-sided hypothesis test,
  using 5\% as the significance level.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Question 5}\label{question-5}

How reliable is the hypothesis test conducted in Question 4b?

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\item
  What is the power of the two-sided test in Question 4b given the
  sample sizes (12 for stable SS families and 910 for IBF) and expected
  proportions on welfare for each group (0.25 for stable SS families and
  0.15 for IBF)? In other words, what is the probability of rejecting
  the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is false?
\item
  Suppose you are able to design a new study and you expect the
  proportion on welfare for \texttt{ibf} and stable \texttt{ss} families
  the same as those in Question 4b (0.25 for stable SS families and 0.15
  for IBF). What is the minimum sample size (in each group) necessary to
  detect a statistically significant difference with 90\% power? Assume
  equal sample size for stable \texttt{ss} and \texttt{ibf} families.
\item
  Given your answer above, discuss some of the challenges that Regnerus
  likely faced in trying to collect nationally-representative data
  comparing adults raised in same-sex households and those that were
  not? Why might this study be more successful, in terms of sampling the
  target populations, in 15-20 years? Be concise in your answer.
\end{enumerate}
