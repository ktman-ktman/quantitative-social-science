\maketitle


A recent paper by Broockman and Kalla, explored in an earlier exercise
of \emph{QSS}, asked if individual minds could be changed with respect
to contentious political topics, particularly transgender rights.
Broockman and Kalla developed a field experiment where individuals were
randomly assigned to receive different treatments and their attitudes
toward transgender rights were measured before and after the treatment.
The paper that describes their findings will be the basis of this
excercise:

Broockman, David, and Joshua Kalla (2016).
``\href{https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aad9713}{Durably reducing
transphobia: A field experiment on door-to-door canvassing}.''
\emph{Science} 352(6282): 220-224.

Broockman and Kalla were focused on whether perspective-taking --
``imagining the world from another's vantage point'' -- might be
particularly effective in reducing intergroup prejudice. Therefore,
participants in the treatment group were visited by a canvasser---some
of whom were transgender and some of whom were not---and asked to think
about a time when they were judged unfairly and were guided to translate
that experience to a transgender individual's experience. A placebo
group had conversation with canvassers about recycling.

The data you will use, \texttt{broockman\_kalla\_2016.csv}, contains all
the variables you will need. The names and descriptions of variables are
shown below. You may not need to use all of these variables for this
activity. We've kept these unnecessary variables in the dataset because
it is common to receive a dataset with much more information than you
need. Some of the items appeared on multiple surveys; the \texttt{\#}
sign below will be replaced with the survey number in your analysis:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  the baseline (pre-treatment) survey is survey 0;
\item
  the 3-day survey is survey 1;
\item
  the 3-week survey is survey 2;
\item
  the 6-week survey is survey 3, and;
\item

\subsection{Question 1}\label{question-1}

First, load \texttt{broockman\_kalla\_2016.csv} into R and explore the
data. How many observations are there? This file includes all of the
people that the researchers \emph{attempted} to contact. As we've
learned, experiments also experience this noncompliance. However, many
of these people did not even respond to the baseline survey before the
experiment was conducted. As such, we are not be able to estimate how
the treatment changed these individuals' attitudes, since we don't know
where they were to begin with. To deal with these people who were never
reached, subset your data so that you are only looking at people who
have a valid (non-NA) answer for \texttt{therm\_trans\_t0}, which was
collected in the pre-treatment baseline study.

How many observations are you left with? How many are assigned to
treatment? Placebo? What do these numbers tell us about the
randomization process? You should use this subset for the rest of this
questions in this part of the exam.

\subsection{Question 2}\label{question-2}

To examine the effect of these conversations, Broockman and Kalla
compared how people in the treatment and placebo groups evaluated
transgender people on a specific type of survey question called a
``feeling thermometer,'' where respondents indicate where their feelings
fall on a scale of 0 (very cold) to 100 (very warm). Further, to measure
whether the changes persisted, Broockman and Kalla also conducted
follow-up surveys up to 3 months after the original treatment. Thus,
Brookman and Kalla's study required reaching participants in multiple
ways: both for a face-to-face interaction where the treatment would be
delivered and through multiple follow-up surveys where the long-term
effects of the treatment could be measured.

We would like to further check that noncompliance did not meaningfully
affect our randomization, since the basis of calculating our treatment
effect depends on this. To do this, we can conduct a \emph{placebo test}
to ensure that the average level of support (our outcome) is not
meaningfully different between the treatment and control groups
\emph{before} treatment was administered (during the baseline survey).
Conduct a t-test on support before treatment was administered ($t=0$)
between the treatment and control groups among the subset of people you
calculated in question 1. Construct a 95\% confidence interval around
your estimate. If the null hypothesis is no difference between the two
groups, can you reject the null hypothesis?

\subsection{Question 3}\label{question-3}

To simplify our analysis, we will focus on the average treatment effects
among the treated (ATT). Kalla and Broockman experienced noncompliance
in their study, where individuals assigned to the treatment group
refused to engage in conversations with canvassers. Because accounting
for this noncompliance statistically is beyond the scope of this class,
we will look only at the cases where treatment was actually delivered.
In contrast, Broockman and Kalla estimate the average treatment effect
of compliers (adjusting for compliance rates). They also include many
covariates; we will only include a few. For these reasons and others,
our estimates may differ slightly.

Next, let's see if the attitudes in the treatment and placebo changed
after the treatment was administered and for how long these differences
lasted. Perform four difference-in-means calculations---one for each
wave $(t=1,2,3,4)$. When performing each test, remove any NAs in that
wave. (These NAs might arise from participants failing to complete
different waves of the surveys---a process that social scientists call
``attrition''---or for other reasons.) For example, for wave 1, use all
cases that don't have missing outcome data in wave 1, and in wave 2, use
all cases that don't have missing outcome data in wave 2 (in the
\texttt{t.test()} function, you can accomplish this with the
\texttt{na.action = na.omit} argument). Construct 95\% confidence
intervals for your estimates. At each stage, do we reject or retain the
null hypothesis that no difference between the two groups exists? You
are welcome to use \texttt{t.test()} to calculate these differences and
the confidence intervals, but pick one comparison and calculate the
estimates by hand (the techniques in Section 7.1 of \emph{QSS} may be
helpful).

\subsection{Question 4}\label{question-4}

Let's focus on the difference-in-means test at time $t=1$. If the null
hypothesis is that there is no difference between the groups, what would
it mean to make a type I error? What would it mean to make a type II
error? If we did something to increase the statistical power of the
study, would we increase or decrease the probability of a type II error?

\subsection{Question 5}\label{question-5}

Finally, let's approximate the estimation strategy used by Broockman and
Kalla in their analysis. To estimate the average treatment effect, they
use a regression framework. Regress the feeling thermometer dependent
variable (measure at time $t=3$) on treatment assignment. To further
alleviate concerns of imbalances between treatment and control groups,
adjust for an individual's feeling thermometer scores at time $t=0$, her
age, gender, race, and political party. Further, to account for possible
differences between the more than 50 canvassers, please include in your
model a fixed effect (i.e., dummy variable) for each canvasser. What is
the estimated treatment effect (be sure to mention units)? Is this
estimate statistically significant at the 0.05 level? Conduct the same
analysis for surveys three months after treatment ($t=4$) and compare
the effects and statistical significance. Provide a substantive
interpretation of the results.
