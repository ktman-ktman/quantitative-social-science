\maketitle


In this exercise, we examine a hypothesis that individuals who lost
someone in the terrorist attacks of 9/11, whether a family relative or a
neighbor, will have become more politically engaged.

This exercise is based on: Hersh, E. D. 2013.
``\href{http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1315043110}{Long-Term Effect of
September 11 on the Political Behavior of Victims' Families and
Neighbors.}'' \emph{Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences}
110(52): 20959--63.

We will examine this hypothesis using several different estimation
techniques, focusing throughout on the effect of the attacks on the
victims' families rather than their neighbors. The CSV data file,
\texttt{victims9-11.csv}, contains the following variables:

Voters were included in the data on the basis of their relationship to
actual victims - these constitute the two treatment groups - or if no
such relationship existed but they were, otherwise, sufficiently similar
to voters in the treatment groups - this constitutes the control group.

\subsection{Question 1}\label{question-1}

We begin by reformatting the data to facilitate our analysis. The three
variables that contain non-numerical values are sex, party, and voting
records. Rewrite these variables using the following coding rules: for
the party variable, assign the value of $1$ to all Democrats, $-1$ to
all Republicans, and $0$ for all other parties and non-affiliated
citizens; for the sex variable, assign the value of $1$ to all female
citizens and $0$ to all male citizens; finally, for each of the seven
voting record variables, assign the value of $1$ if the individual voted
in a given election, and $0$ otherwise.

\subsection{Question 2}\label{question-2}

We will now test the hypothesis. Calculate the sample Average Treatment
Effect of the terrorist attacks on voter turnout separately for each of
the seven general elections between 2000 and 2012. Focus on families of
victims as the treatment, and disregard the neighbor category. For each
of the seven point-estimates, compute the corresponding standard error.
Assume that both the treatment and control groups form two random
samples, and that the two samples are statistically independent. Then,
using the quantiles of the standard normal distribution, calculate the
95\% confidence intervals for each of the seven point-estimates. Plot
the results where the horizontal axis represents the elections. Provide
a brief interpretation, with a particular focus on the meaning of the
confidence intervals you computed.

\subsection{Question 3}\label{question-3}

To examine the validity of the cross-sectional comparisons conducted in
Question 2, check whether possible confounders are balanced between the
treatment and control groups. Compare the means of the last six
variables in the table above across the two groups along with their 95\%
confidence intervals. Provide a brief interpretation of the results.
What can you conclude about the validity of the cross-sectional
comparisons?

\subsection{Question 4}\label{question-4}

Now, focus on the treatment group only. Compute the before-and-after
estimate of the effect of the terrorist attacks on voter turnout for
families of the victims by using the 2000 general election as a baseline
for each of the subsequent six general elections. Next, calculate the
standard errors corresponding to the six point-estimates. Using the
standard errors, compute the 95\% confidence intervals for each of the
six point-estimates. Plot the results. Provide a brief interpretation of
your findings. \textbf{Hint}: Since you are now tracing the same sample
evolve through time, you can no longer assume the independence of sample
means in calculating the standard errors; take care to incorporate the
covariance between voter turnout in 2000 and a subsequent election into
your calculations.

\subsection{Question 5}\label{question-5}

We will now repeat the same analysis as in Question 4, but now using
voters in the control group only. As before, be sure to restrict your
analysis to family relatives of control victims rather than their
neighbors. What does this analysis imply about the validity of the
analysis in the previous question?

\subsection{Question 6}\label{question-6}

Calculate the difference-in-differences estimate for the general
elections immediately surrounding the attacks, 2000 and 2002. Calculate
the standard error for your estimate, and provide the 95\% confidence
interval. Once again, you are allowed to use the quantiles of the
standard normal distribution in calculating the confidence interval.
Provide a brief interpretation of the result.

\subsection{Question 7}\label{question-7}

Repeat the previous difference-in-differences analysis for all six
elections following the attacks. Throughout this analysis, use the 2000
election as the baseline as done in the previous question. Plot the
results with the horizontal axis representing different elections.
Provide a substantive interpretation of the results.
