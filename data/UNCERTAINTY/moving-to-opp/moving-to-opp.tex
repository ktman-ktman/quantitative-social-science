\maketitle


Millions of low-income Americans live in high-poverty neighborhoods,
which also tend to be racially segregated and often dangerous. While
social scientists have long believed that living in these neighborhoods
contributes to negative outcomes for its residents, it is often
difficult to establish a causal link between neighborhood conditions and
individual outcomes. The Moving to Opportunity (MTO) demonstration was
designed to test whether offering housing vouchers to families living in
public housing in high-poverty neighborhoods could improve their lives
by helping them move to lower-poverty neighborhoods.

Between 1994 and 1998 the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development enrolled 4,604 low-income households from from public
housing projects in Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, and New
York in MTO, randomly assigning enrolled families in each site to one of
three groups: (1) The low-poverty voucher group received special MTO
vouchers, which could only be used in census tracts with 1990 poverty
rates below 10\% and counseling to assist with relocation, (2) the
traditional voucher group received regular section 8 vouchers, which
they could use anywhere, and (3) the control group, who received no
vouchers but continued to qualify for any project-based housing
assistance they were entitled to receive. Today we will use the MTO data
to learn if being given the opportunity to move to lower-poverty
neighborhoods actually improved participants' economic and subjective
wellbeing. This exercise is based on the following article:

Ludwig, J., Duncan, G.J., Gennetian, L.A., Katz, L.F., Kessler, J.R.K.,
and Sanbonmatsu, L., 2012.
``\href{https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1224648}{Neighborhood Effects
on the Long-Term Well-Being of Low-Income Adults}.'' \emph{Science},
Vol. 337, Issue 6101, pp.~1505-1510.

The file \texttt{mto.csv} includes the following variables for 3,263
adult participants in the voucher and control groups:

The data we will use are not the original data, this dataset has been
modified to protect participants' confidentiality, but the results of
our analysis will be consistent with published data on the MTO
demonstration. In the Science article the authors pooled the two voucher
groups into a single treatment group because their outcomes converged
over time. We will follow their strategy to assess the experiment's
results.

\subsection{Question 1}\label{question-1}

Did receiving MTO vouchers improve economic self-sufficiency
(econ\_ss\_zscore) and subjective wellbeing (wellbeing\_zscore) among
treatment group participants? Begin by creating a new variable
\texttt{treatment} based on the \texttt{group} variable where \texttt{1}
indicates membership in the \texttt{lpv} or \texttt{sec8} groups
(treatment group) and \texttt{0} indicates membership in the control
group. First, test the null hypothesis that the mean subjective
wellbeing variable for the treatment group is 0 with the alternative
hypothesis that it is greater than 0. Second, conduct a two-sample,
two-sided hypotheses test to assess if MTO influenced economic
self-sufficiency and subjective wellbeing, respectively. Throughout this
question, use 5\% as the significance threshold.

\subsection{Question 2}\label{question-2}

MTO was designed to test whether \emph{moving} from a high-poverty to a
low-poverty neighborhood improved individual outcomes. But the MTO
intervention only provided vouchers and counseling that would facilitate
relocation for the treatment group. It would have been unethical to
force treatment group members to move and force control group members to
stay where they were living. Treatment group individuals could choose
not to relocate, and control group individuals could choose to relocate.
About half of the participants who received MTO vouchers actually
complied with the experiment by using their vouchers to move to a
low-poverty neighborhood.

Restrict the data to voucher recipients (groups \texttt{lpv} and
\texttt{sec8}) and compute the proportion of compliers among the
traditional section 8 voucher recipients and the low-poverty voucher
recipients. Test the hypothesis that compliance among the traditional
section 8 voucher recipients was greater than among the low-poverty
voucher recipients. Is the difference in proportions significant at the
5\% significance level?

\subsection{Question 3}\label{question-3}

Explore the possibility that the null result we observed for economic
self-suffiency was the consequence of low compliance among voucher
recipients in some MTO sites (i.e.~cities). Compliance, defined as using
a voucher if one is assigned to the treatment (either \texttt{lpv} or
\texttt{sec8} groups), ranged from a low of 36\% in Chicago to 68\% in
Los Angeles. Examine whether the treatment had an effect on economic
self-sufficiency in Los Angeles, the MTO city with the highest
compliance rate. Specifically, conduct a two-sided t-test at the 5\%
significance level with the null hypothesis that the average treatment
effect of MTO on economic self sufficiency for MTO participants in Los
Angeles participants is zero. Next, compute the power of this test
assuming that the estimates based on this sample are equal to their true
values. Under this assumption, what is the minimum sample size necessary
to detect the observed difference in economic self-sufficiency at the
95\% significance level?

\subsection{Question 4}\label{question-4}

In the Science article, the authors assessed the long-term effects of
receiving an MTO housing voucher on four outcomes. Three of these
outcomes were indices of economic self-sufficiency, physical health, and
mental health, which allowed them to aggregate 14 separate outcomes into
three domains of wellbeing. The fourth outcome was a single measure of
subjective wellbeing. Thus, instead of conducting 15 separate hypothesis
tests, they did only four tests.

Assume that the authors had not aggregated these various outcomes into
indices and had instead tested hypotheses for each of the 15 outcome
measures they employed. At the 5\% significance level, what is the
probability that the authors would have rejected at least one out of 15
null hypotheses, even if all null hypotheses were true? What is the
probability that they would have rejected at least 3 null hypotheses,
even if all hypotheses were true? What about at the 1\% significance
level? Now, compare these probabilities with the probability of
rejecting at least one out of 4 true null hypothesis at the 5\% and 1\%
significance levels. Which pitfall of hypothesis testing were the
authors able to avoid with this strategy? For this question, assume that
each test is independent.
