\maketitle


In this exercise, we will analyze the relationship between various
demographic traits and pro-feminist voting behavior among circuit court
judges. In a recent paper, Adam N. Glynn and Maya Sen argue that having
a female child causes circuit court judges to make more pro-feminist
decisions. The paper can be found at:

\subsection{Question 1}\label{question-1}

Load the \texttt{dbj.csv} file. Find how many judges there are in the
dataset, as well as the gender and party composition of our dataset. Is
the party composition different for male and female judges?
Additionally, note that our outcome in this exercise will be the
proportion of pro-feminist rulings. What is the range of this variable
(\texttt{progressive.vote})?

\subsection{Question 2}\label{question-2}

Next, we consider differences between some groups. For each of the four
groups (Republican men/women, Democratic men/women) defined by gender
and partisanship, create a boxplot (using a single command) that
illustrates the differences in \texttt{progressive.vote}. Briefly
interpret the results of the analysis. For example, do any of the
results surprise you? Does it appear that partisanship, gender, or both
contribute to progressive voting patterns? Should we interpret any of
these effects causally? Why or why not?

\subsection{Question 3}\label{question-3}

Create a new binary variable which takes a value of \texttt{1} if a
judge has \emph{at least} one child (that is, any children at all),
\texttt{0} otherwise. Then, use this variable to answer the following
questions. Are Republicans and Democrats equally likely to be parents
(that is, have at least one child)? Do judges with children vote
differently than judges without? If so, how are they different? Do
republican and democratic parents vote differently on feminist issues?

\subsection{Question 4}\label{question-4}

What is the difference in the proportion of pro-feminist decisions
between judges who have at least one daughter and those who do not have
any? Compute this difference in two ways; (1) using the entire sample,
(2) separately by the number of children judges have (only considering
judges that have 3 children or less). What assumptions are required for
us to interpret these differences as causal estimates?

\subsection{Question 5}\label{question-5}

Next, we are going to consider the design of this study. The original
authors assume that conditional on the number of children a judge has
the number of daughters is random (as we did in the previous question).
Indeed, this is the assumption that would justify the analysis of the
previous question. For example, among the judges who have two children,
the number of daughters -- either \texttt{0}, \texttt{1}, or \texttt{2}
-- has nothing to do with the (observed or unobserved) pre-treatment
characteristics of judges. Is this assumption reasonable? Is there a
scenario under which this assumption can be violated? Do the data
support the assumption?
