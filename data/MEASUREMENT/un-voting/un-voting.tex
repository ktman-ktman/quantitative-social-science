Like legislators in the US Congress, the member states of the United
Nations (UN) are politically divided on many issues such as trade,
nuclear disarmament, and human rights. During the Cold War, countries in
the UN General Assembly tended to split into two factions: one led by
the capitalist United States and the other by the communist Soviet
Union. In this exercise, we will analyze how states' ideological
positions, as captured by their votes on UN resolutions, have changed
since the fall of communism.

This exercise is based on Michael A. Bailey, Anton Strezhnev, and Erik
Voeten. ``Estimating Dynamic State Preferences from United Nations
Voting Data.'' \emph{Journal of Conflict Resolution}, August 2015.

The data is called \texttt{unvoting.csv} and the variables are:

In the analysis that follows, we measure state preferences in two ways.
Note that the data for 1964 are missing due to the absence of roll call
data.

First, we can use the percentage of votes by each country that coincide
with votes on the same issue cast by the two major Cold War powers: the
United States and the Soviet Union. For example, if a country voted for
ten resolutions in 1992, and if its vote matched the United States's
vote on exactly six of these resolutions, the variable
\texttt{PctAgreeUS} in 1992 would equal 60 for this country.

Second, we can also measure state preferences in terms of numerical
ideal points.\\These ideal points capture what international relations
scholars have called countries' \emph{liberalism} on issues such as
political freedom, democratization, and financial liberalization. The
two measures are highly correlated, with larger (more liberal) ideal
points corresponding to a higher percentage of votes that agree with the
US.

\subsection{Question 1}\label{question-1}

We begin by examining how the distribution of state ideal points has
changed since the end of communism. Plot the distribution of ideal
points separately for 1980 and 2000 - about ten years before and after
the fall of the Berlin Wall, respectively. Add median to each plot as a
vertical line. How do the two distributions differ? Pay attention to the
degree of polarization and give a brief substantive interpretation of
the results. Use the \texttt{quantile} function to quantify the patterns
you identified.

\subsection{Question 2}\label{question-2}

Next, examine how the number of countries voting with the US has changed
over time. Plot the average percent agreement with US across all
counties over time. Also, add the average percent agreement with Russia
as another line for comparison. Does the US appear to be getting more or
less isolated over time, as compared to Russia? What are some countries
that are consistently pro-US? What are the most pro-Russian countries?
Give a brief substantive interpretation of the results.

\subsection{Question 3}\label{question-3}

One problem of using the percentage of votes that agree with the US or
Russia as a measure of state preferences is that the ideological
positions, and consequently the voting patterns, of the two countries
might have themselves changed over time. This makes it difficult to know
which countries' ideological positions have changed. Investigate this
issue by plotting the evolution of the two countries' ideal points over
time. Add the yearly median ideal point of all countries. How might the
results of this analysis modify (or not) your interpretation of the
previous analysis?

\subsection{Question 4}\label{question-4}

Let's examine how countries that were formerly part of the Soviet Union
differ in terms of their ideology and UN voting compared to countries
that were not part of the Soviet Union. The former Soviet Union
countries are: Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Belarus, Moldova, Ukraine,
Armenia, Azerbaijian, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan,
Uzbekistan, and Russia. The \texttt{\%in\%} operator, which is used as
\texttt{x \%in\% y}, may be useful. This operator returns a logical
vector whose element is \texttt{TRUE} (\texttt{FALSE}) if the
corresponding element of vector \texttt{x} is equal to a value contained
in vector \texttt{y}. Focus on the most recently available UN data from
2012 and plot each Post-Soviet Union state's ideal point against the
percentage of its votes that agree with the United States. Compare the
post Soviet Union states, within the same plot, against the other
countries. Briefly comment on what you observe.

\subsection{Question 5}\label{question-5}

We have just seen that while some post-Soviet countries have retained
non-liberal ideologies, other post-Soviet countries were much more
liberal in 2012. Let's examine how the median ideal points of
Soviet/post-Soviet countries and all other countries has varied over all
the years in the data. Plot these median ideal points by year. Be sure
to indicate 1989, the year of the fall of the Berlin Wall, on the graph.
Briefly comment on what you observe.

\subsection{Question 6}\label{question-6}

Following the end of communism, countries that were formerly part of the
Soviet Union have become much more ideologically diverse. Is this also
true of the world as a whole? In other words, do countries still divide
into two ideological factions? Let's assess this question by applying
the \texttt{k}-means clustering algorithm to ideal points and the
percentage of votes agreeing with the US. Initiate the algorithm with
just two centroids and visualize the results separately for 1989 and
2012. Briefly comment on the results.

\subsection{Question 7}\label{question-7}

We saw earlier that the median post-Soviet country joined the liberal
cluster after the fall of communism. Which countries, possibly from
outside the Soviet Union, followed suit? Conversely, are there countries
that exited the liberal cluster after the end of communism? Identify the
countries which were in the non-liberal cluster in 1989 but belonged to
the liberal cluster in 2012. Again, the \texttt{\%in\%} operator may be
useful. Then, do the reverse, so that you can see which countries exited
the liberal cluster. Briefly comment on what you observe.
