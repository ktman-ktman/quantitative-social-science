\maketitle


Can transphobia be reduced through in-person conversations and
perspective-taking exercises, or \emph{active processing}? Following up
on \href{http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1256151}{the research} that
was shown to be fabricated, two researchers conducted a door-to-door
canvassing experiment in South Florida targeting anti-transgender
prejudice in order to answer this question. Canvassers held single,
approximately 10-minute conversations that encouraged actively taking
the perspective of others with voters to see if these conversations
could markedly reduce prejudice. This exercise is based on the following
study:

Broockman, David and Joshua Kalla. 2016.
``\href{https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.aad9713}{Durably reducing
transphobia: a field experiment on door-to-door canvassing}.''
\emph{Science}, Vol. 352, No. 6282, pp.~220-224.

In the experiment, the authors first recruited registered voters
($n=68378$) via mail for an online baseline survey, presented as the
first in a series of surveys. They then randomly assigned respondents of
this baseline survey ($n=1825$) to either a treatment group targeted
with the intervention ($n=913$) or a placebo group targeted with a
conversation about recycling ($n=912$). For the intervention, 56
canvassers first knocked on voters' doors unannounced. Then, canvassers
asked to speak with the subject on their list and confirmed the person's
identity if the person came to the door. A total of several hundred
individuals ($n=501$) came to their doors in the two conditions. For
logistical reasons unrelated to the original study, we further reduce
this dataset to ($n=488$) which is the full sample that appears in the
\texttt{transphobia.csv} data.

The canvassers then engaged in a series of strategies previously shown
to facilitate active processing under the treatment condition:
canvassers informed voters that they might face a decision about the
issue (whether to vote to repeal the law protecting transgender people);
canvassers asked voters to explain their views; and canvassers showed a
video that presented arguments on both sides. Canvassers defined the
term ``transgender'' at this point and, if they were transgender
themselves, noted this. The canvassers next attempted to encourage
``analogic perspective-taking''. Canvassers first asked each voter to
talk about a time when they themselves were judged negatively for being
different. The canvassers then encouraged voters to see how their own
experience offered a window into transgender people's experiences,
hoping to facilitate voters' ability to take transgender people's
perspectives. The intervention ended with another attempt to encourage
active processing by asking voters to describe if and how the exercise
changed their mind. All of the former steps constitutes the
``treatment.''

The placebo group was reminded that recycling was most effective when
everyone participates. The canvassers talked about how they were working
on ways to decrease environmental waste and asked the voters who came to
the door about their support for a new law that would require
supermarkets to charge for bags instead of giving them away for free.
This was meant to mimic the effect of canvassers interacting with the
voters in face-to-face conversation on a topic different from
transphobia.

The authors then asked the individuals who came to their doors in either
condition ($n=488$) to complete follow-up online surveys via email
presented as a continuation of the baseline survey. These follow-up
surveys began 3 days, 3 weeks, 6 weeks, and 3 months after the
intervention when the baseline survey was also conducted. For the
purposes of this exercise, we will be using the \texttt{tolerance.t\#}
variables (where \texttt{\#} is 0 through 4) as the main outcome
variables of interest. The authors constructed these dependent variables
\texttt{tolerance.t\#} as indexes by using several other measures that
are not included in this exercise. In building this index, the authors
scaled the variables such that they have a mean of 0 and standard
deviation of 1 for the placebo group. Higher values indicate higher
tolerance, lower values indicate lower tolerance relative to the placebo
group.

The data set is the file \texttt{transphobia.csv}. Variables that begin
with \texttt{vf\_} come from the voter file. Variables in this dataset
are described below:

\subsection{Question 1}\label{question-1}

For each of the five waves, including the baseline survey, compute the
sample average treatment effect of being assigned (\texttt{treat\_ind})
to having an in-person conversation about perspective-taking for
transgender issues on tolerance towards the transgender community.
Interpret the estimates and provide their implications for the internal
validity of the study as well as the hypothesis in question. Pay
attention to how the outcome variables were created when interpreting
the size of estimated treatment effect. Next, plot the average tolerance
level separately for the treatment and placebo group over time. Use
solid (open) circles for the treatment (placebo) groups, respectively,
and connect these points with lines. The horizontal axis should
represent the number of days from the baseline survey. Interpret the
resulting graph.

\subsection{Question 2}\label{question-2}

We might wish to know the stickiness of attitudes over time. Compute
(separately) the correlation coefficients for the treatment and placebo
groups (based on assignment to treatment or placebo) across each 2-way
combination of the dependent variables: \texttt{tolerance.t0},
\texttt{tolerance.t1}, \texttt{tolerance.t2}, \texttt{tolerance.t3} and
\texttt{tolerance.t4}? Then find the difference in correlation
coefficients between the placebo and treatment groups. Interpret the
resulting correlations. Is there a difference across the groups?

\subsection{Question 3}\label{question-3}

The authors of the study posited that it might be possible that
Republicans, Democrats, and Independents respond differently to the
treatment from one another because of party policy differences. It is
also possible that respondent race might interact with the treatment in
different ways resulting in different treatment effects. That is, there
might be heterogeneous treatment effects of being assigned to the
treatment (\texttt{treat\_ind}) with \texttt{vf\_party} and/or
\texttt{vf\_racename}. Evaluate whether these two hypotheses are true by
finding the differences in average treatment effects by party as well as
by race in treatment and placebo groups across waves. Provide a time
series plot of the treatment effects over time separately by party and
by race with informative labels. Interpret the resulting plots. Pay
attention to how the outcome variables were created when interpreting
the magnitude of treatment effects.

\subsection{Question 4}\label{question-4}

Attrition, or drop-out, is a common problem for panel survey studies. In
the case of the transphobia experiment, some individuals who responded
to the baseline survey did not complete follow up surveys. Examine the
extent to which the sample remained representative of the original
sample with the implementation of each survey wave, by computing the
attrition rate (i.e., the proportion of baseline survey respondents who
did not answer each subsequent survey) separately for the placebo and
treatment groups over time. What is the attrition rate for placebo and
treatment groups going from Baseline (Wave 0) to 3 days (Wave 1)? From
Baseline (Wave 0) to 3 weeks (Wave 2)? Continue for all Waves and create
a time series plot for the attrition rate by group. Do we observe any
asymmetrical attrition based on treatment group? How might differences
in attrition across groups affect how we interpret our findings?

Moreover, is attrition more likely along certain covariates? Explore
this question with regards to \texttt{vf\_female} and
\texttt{vf\_party}, calculating the attrition rate for each subgroup
(female, male, democrat, republican) in Wave 4 only. Comment on some of
the implications attrition through these covariates would have for the
analysis.

\subsection{Question 5}\label{question-5}

We have defined the treatment and placebo groups based on the condition
to which an individual was randomly assigned. However, in the experiment
not everyone assigned to the treatment condition received the treatment.
Of the 236 individuals who identified themselves at their doors in the
treatment group, 185 began the conversation about transphobia rather
than refusing to talk at all after identifying themselves and hearing
the canvassers' introduction. In addition, the treatment (conversation
about transphobia) was inadvertently delivered to 11 individuals in the
placebo group (who were supposed to have a conversation about recycling)
due to canvasser error.

Compute the average difference in the tolerance level (separately for
each wave as done in Question 1) among the people assigned to treatment
status who actually received the treatment conversation, compared to the
people assigned to placebo status who received the placebo conversation.
Create a time series graph of the average treatment effects for the
subgroup of people assigned to treatment status who actually received
the treatment conversation and the people assigned to placebo status who
received the placebo conversation compared to the full sample across
time. How do the estimates differ from those computed in Question 1?

To investigate the validity of these new estimates, compute the
proportion of individuals who, among those contacted, actually engaged
in the in-person conversation. Does this contact rate vary by whether
the respondent is male or female (\texttt{vf\_female})? By party
(\texttt{vf\_party})? By race (\texttt{vf\_race})? What do the results
of this analysis imply about (1) the difference between these new
estimates and those computed in Question 1 and (2) the internal validity
of these new estimates? What does this complication of only some
respondents receiving the treatment imply when interpreting the results
presented in Question 1?
