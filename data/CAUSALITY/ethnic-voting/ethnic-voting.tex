To explore whether a political candidate can utilize his wife's
ethnicity to garner coethnic support (where a voter prefers to vote for
a candidate of his/her own ethnic group, and a well-established
phenomenon in many African democracies), a group of researchers used
observational time-series cross sectional data from the Afrobarometer (a
public attitude survey on democracy and governance in more than 35
countries in Africa, see
\href{http://www.afrobarometer.org/}{Afrobarometer}) to establish
patterns of preferring a president based on a coethnic presidential
wife. The researchers then conducted an experiment where they randomly
reminded potential voters in Benin that the Beninoise President Yayi
Boni's wife, Chantal, is of the ethnic Fon group and asked them whether
they approve of Yayi Boni. This exercise is based on:

Adida, Claire, Nathan Combes, Adeline Lo, and Alex Verink. 2016.
``\href{http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0010414015621080}{The Spousal Bump: Do
Cross-Ethnic Marriages Increase Political Support in Multiethnic
Democracies?}'' \emph{Comparative Political Studies}, Vol. 49, No. 5,
pp.~635-661.

In the first dataset from Afrobarometer, the researchers focus on
African democracies where information could be garnered about the
ethnicities of the president and wife. For the purposes of this
exercise, only African democracies where the president and wife are not
of the same ethnicity are considered (i.e., the president and wife are
not coethnic with one another), and the data is pre-subsetted to include
only president non-coethnics. We will consider patterns of willingness
to vote for the president amongst wife coethnics and non-coethnics
across African democracies. Descriptions of the relevant variables in
the data file \texttt{afb.csv} are:

The second dataset is a survey experiment in Cotonou, Benin. Here the
researchers randomly assigned survey respondents short biolographical
passages on the then Beninoise president Yayi Boni that included no
mention of his wife, included a mention of his wife, or included a
mention of his Fon wife. Respondents were then asked whether they were
willing to vote for Yayi Boni should an election be held and barring
term limits. The goal of the experiment was to assess whether priming
respondents about the president's Fon wife might raise support amongst
wife coethnics for the president. Two pre-subsetted data from
\texttt{benin.csv} are also provided: \texttt{coethnic.csv} which
subsets \texttt{benin.csv} to only coethnic respondents with the wife,
and \texttt{noncoethnic.csv} which subsets \texttt{benin.csv} to only
noncoethnic respondents with the wife. Descriptions of the relevant

\subsection{Question 1}\label{question-1}

Load the \texttt{afb.csv} data set. Look at a summary of the
\texttt{afb} data to get a sense of what it looks like. Obtain a list of
African democracies that are in the data set. Create a new binary
variable, which is equal to \texttt{1} if the \texttt{ethnicpercent}
variable is greater than its mean and is equal to \texttt{0} otherwise.
Call this new variable \texttt{ethnicpercent2}.

\subsection{Question 2}\label{question-2}

What is the average willingness to vote for the president among all
respondents? Now compute the average willingess separately for
respondents who are coethnic with the presidential wife and respondents
who are not. Given our initial hypothesis about how a president might be
able to use his wife's ethnicity to get more support, how might we
interpret the differences (or similarities) in the support amongst
coethnics and non-coethnics?

\subsection{Question 3}\label{question-3}

We might be concerned that we have not taken into account potentially
confounding factors such as whether 1) the respondent is part of a
proportionally larger or smaller ethnic group and 2) whether the
respondent is also coethnic with the major opposition leader. This is
because if a respondent's ethnic group is quite small, the members might
be less able to put forth a candidate of their exact ethnic label and
have more incentive to support a president who, while not the same
ethnicity, has a wife who does (and who therefore might have the wife's
ethnic group interests at heart). It may also be that should an
opposition candidate hold the same ethnicity as the respondent, such a
``wife effect'' might be diminished.

To investigate this possibility, subset the \texttt{afb} data to adjust
for potential confounding variable \texttt{ethnicpercent2} created in
the previous question. Consider the group of individuals who are of
smaller than average ethnic groups. What is the average willingness to
vote between wife coethnics and wife non-coethnics? Next, consider only
the group of individuals who are not only from smaller than average
ethnic groups but are also not coethnic with the opponent. What is the
difference in average willingness to vote between wife coethnics and
wife non-coethnics now? What do these results tell us about the
relationship between the ``wife effect''?

\subsection{Question 4}\label{question-4}

The Afrobarometer data, while rich and inclusive of many countries, is
observational data. Thus, it is difficult to estimate the effect of
\emph{treatment}, which is coethnicity with the president's wife in the
current application. To address this difficulty, the authors of the
study conduct a survey experiment in Benin, a small democracy on the
western coast of the African continent. It is also a country represented
in the Afrobarometer data set. The president at the time of the survey
was Yayi Boni, who is of two ethnicities, Nago and Bariba. His wife
Chantal is Fon. For the experiment, the authors randomly surveyed adult
walkers on the streets of Cotonou (the capital of Benin). Respondents
were asked some personal information, such as gender and age, as well as
their ethnicity. Then, respondents were randomly assigned to either the
control or one of two treatment groups (\emph{Wife} and \emph{Fon
Wife}):

In the control condition, respondents were read the following short
biographical sketchof Yayi Boni, where there is no indication of the
president's wife, Chantal:

\begin{quote}
Yayi Boni became President of Benin on April 6, 2006 and was just
re-elected for a second term. He has led a presidential campaign based
on economic growth and suppressing corruption. However, some critics
claim that the country's economic growth has been disappointing, and
that Boni's administration is, itself, corrupt.
\end{quote}

In the first treatment group, \emph{Wife}, respondents were read the
same passage as the control group, except the president's wife Chantal
is explicitly mentioned at the beginning. That is, the above script is
preceded with ``Accompanied by his wife, Chantal''. In the second
treatment group, \emph{Fon Wife}, respondents were read again the same
passage, except the ethnicity of Chantal is explicitly mentioned with
the script starting by ``Accompnaied by his Fon wife, Chantal''.

Now we turn to the \texttt{benin} dataset. Does being reminded that you
are coethnic with the president's wife increase your willingness to vote
for the president? The data has already been subsetted from the original
experiment data so it contains only respondents who are not coethnic
with the president (why would this be important to consider?). Take a
closer look at the \texttt{ethnicity} variable by creating a table. How
many ethnic groups are there represented in this dataset? Compare the
mean willingness to vote for the president between the \emph{Fon Wife}
and control group. Briefly interpret the result. Was it important for
the researchers to add a treatment with just the mention of the
president's wife without her ethnicity? Why or why not?

\subsection{Question 5}\label{question-5}

Now compare the mean willingness to vote for the president between the
\emph{Fon Wife} and control group for wife coethnics only (load
\texttt{coethnic.csv} file). Briefly interpret the result. What happens
when we compare wife coethnics in the \emph{Fon Wife} to the \emph{Wife}
group? The \emph{Wife} to the control group? Do these results apply to
respondents who are NOT coethnic with the president's wife (load
\texttt{noncoethnic.csv} file)?
