In this exercise, we analyze the causal effects of a criminal record on
the job prospects of white and black job applicants. This exercise is
based on:

Pager, Devah. (2003). ``\href{https://doi.org/10.1086/374403}{The Mark
of a Criminal Record}.'' \emph{American Journal of Sociology}
108(5):937-975. You are also welcome to watch Professor Pager discuss
the design and result \href{https://youtu.be/nUZqvsF_Wt0}{here}.

To isolate the causal effect of a criminal record for black and white
applicants, Pager ran an audit experiment. In this type of experiment,
researchers present two similar people that differ only according to one
trait thought to be the source of discrimination. This approach was used
in the resume experiment described in Chapter 2 of \emph{QSS}, where
researchers randomly assigned stereotypically African-American-sounding
names and stereotypically white-sounding names to otherwise identical
resumes to measure discrimination in the labor market.

To examine the role of a criminal record, Pager hired a pair of white
men and a pair of black men and instructed them to apply for existing
entry-level jobs in the city of Milwaukee. The men in each pair were
matched on a number of dimensions, including physical appearance and
self-presentation. As much as possible, the only difference between the
two was that Pager randomly varied which individual in the pair would
indicate to potential employers that he had a criminal record. Further,
each week, the pair alternated which applicant would present himself as
an ex-felon. To determine how incarceration and race influence
employment chances, she compared callback rates among applicants with
and without a criminal background and calculated how those callback
rates varied by race.

In the data you will use \texttt{ciminalrecord.csv} nearly all these
cases are present, but 4 cases have been redacted. As a result, your
findings may differ slightly from those in the paper. The names and
descriptions of variables are shown below. You may not need to use all
of these variables for this activity. We've kept these unnecessary
variables in the dataset because it is common to receive a dataset with
much more information than you need.

\subsection{Question 1}\label{question-1}

Begin by loading the data into R and explore the data. How many cases
are there in the data? Run \texttt{summary()} to get a sense of things.
In how many cases is the tester black? In how many cases is he white?

\subsection{Question 2}\label{question-2}

Now we examine the central question of the study. Calculate the
proportion of callbacks for white applicants with and without a criminal
record, and calculate this proportion for black applicants with and
without a criminal record.

\subsection{Question 3}\label{question-3}

What is the difference in callback rates between individuals with and
without a criminal record within each race. What do these specific
results tell us? Consider both the difference in callback rates for
records with and without a criminal record and the ratio of callback
rates for these two types of records.

\subsection{Question 4}\label{question-4}

Compare the callback rates of whites \emph{with} a criminal record
versus blacks \emph{without} a criminal record. What do we learn from
this comparison?

\subsection{Question 5}\label{question-5}

When carrying out this experiment, Pager made many decisions. For
example, she opted to conduct the research in Milwaukee; she could have
done the same experiment in Dallas or Topeka or Princeton. She ran the
study at a specific time: between June and December of 2001. But, she
could have also run it at a different time, say 5 years earlier or 5
years later. Pager decided to hire 23-year-old male college students as
her testers; she could have done the same experiment with 23-year-old
female college students or 40-year-old male high school drop-outs.
Further, the criminal record she randomly assigned to her testers was a
felony convinction related to drugs (possession with intent to
distribute, cocaine). But, she could have assigned her testers a felony
conviction for assault or tax evasion. Pager was very aware of each of
these decisions, and she discusses them in her paper. Now you should
pick \emph{one} of these decisions described above or another decision
of your choosing. Speculate about how the results of the study might (or
might not) change if you were to conduct the same study but alter this
specific decision. This is part of thinking about the \emph{external
validity} of the study.
