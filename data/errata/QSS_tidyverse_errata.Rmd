# Corrections applicable to first printing

## Chapter 3

## Section 3.6.2

* page 120-121. 0 and 1 should be flipped when describing the Gini coefficient in both text and text box. Text should read "In a perfectly equal society, the Gini coefficient is 0. In contrast, a society where one person possesses all the wealth has a Gini coefficient of 1." Text box should read "It ranges from 0 (everyone has the same amount of wealth) to 1 (one person possesses all the wealth)."
