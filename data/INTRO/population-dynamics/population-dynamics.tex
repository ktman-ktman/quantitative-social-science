\maketitle


Understanding population dynamics is important for many areas of social
science. We will calculate some basic demographic quantities of births
and deaths for the world's population from two time periods: 1950 to
1955 and 2005 to 2010. We will analyze the following CSV data files -
\texttt{Kenya.csv}, \texttt{Sweden.csv}, and \texttt{World.csv}. Each
file contains population data for Kenya, Sweden, and the world,
respectively. The table below presents the names and descriptions of the
variables in each data set.

The data are collected for a period of 5 years where \emph{person-year}
is a measure of the time contribution of each person during the period.
For example, a person that lives through the entire 5 year period
contributes 5 person-years whereas someone who only lives through the
first half of the period contributes 2.5 person-years. Before you begin
this exercise, it would be a good idea to directly inspect each data
set. In R, this can be done with the \texttt{View} function, which takes
as its argument the name of a \texttt{data.frame} to be examined.
Alternatively, in RStudio, double-clicking a \texttt{data.frame} in the
\texttt{Environment} tab will enable you to view the data in a
spreadsheet-like view.

\subsection{Question 1}\label{question-1}

We begin by computing \emph{crude birth rate} (CBR) for a given period.
The CBR is defined as: \[ 
    \text{CBR} 
     =  \frac{\text{number of births}}{\text{number of person-years lived}}
  \]

Compute the CBR for each period, separately for Kenya, Sweden, and the
world. Start by computing the total person-years, recorded as a new
variable within each existing \texttt{data.frame} via the \texttt{\$}
operator, by summing the person-years for men and women. Then, store the
results as a vector of length 2 (CBRs for two periods) for each region
with appropriate labels. You may wish to create your own function for
the purpose of efficient programming. Briefly describe patterns you
observe in the resulting CBRs.

\subsection{Question 2}\label{question-2}

The CBR is easy to understand but contains both men and women of all
ages in the denominator. We next calculate the \emph{total fertility
rate} (TFR). Unlike the CBR, the TFR adjusts for age compositions in the
female population. To do this, we need to first calculate the \emph{age
specific fertility rate} (ASFR), which represents the fertility rate for
women of the reproductive age range $[15, 50)$. The ASFR for age range
$[x, x+\delta)$, where $x$ is the starting age and $\delta$ is the width
of the age range (measured in years), is defined as: \[
    \text{ASFR}_{[x,\ x+\delta)} 
    \ = \ \frac{\text{number of births to women of age $[x,\ x+\delta)$}}{\text{Number of person-years lived by women of age $[x,\ x+\delta)$}}
  \] Note that square brackets, $[$ and $]$, include the limit whereas
parentheses, $($ and $)$, exclude it. For example, $[20, 25)$ represents
the age range that is greater than or equal to 20 years old and less
than 25 years old. In typical demographic data, the age range $\delta$
is set to 5 years. Compute the ASFR for Sweden and Kenya as well as the
entire world for each of the two periods. Store the resulting ASFRs
separately for each region. What does the pattern of these ASFRs say
about reproduction among women in Sweden and Kenya?

\subsection{Question 3}\label{question-3}

Using the ASFR, we can define the TFR as the average number of children
women give birth to if they live through their entire reproductive age.
\[
  \text{TFR} 
   =   \text{ASFR}_{[15,\ 20)} \times 5 + \text{ASFR}_{[20,\ 25)} \times 5 
  + \dots + \text{ASFR}_{[45,\ 50)} \times 5
  \]

We multiply each age-specific fertility rate rate by 5 because the age
range is 5 years. Compute the TFR for Sweden and Kenya as well as the
entire world for each of the two periods. As in the previous question,
continue to assume that women's reproductive age range is $[15, 50)$.
Store the resulting two TFRs for each country or the world as a vector
of length two. In general, how has the number of women changed in the
world from 1950 to 2000? What about the total number of births in the
world?

\subsection{Question 4}\label{question-4}

Next, we will examine another important demographic process: death.
Compute the \emph{crude death rate} (CDR), which is a concept analogous
to the CBR, for each period and separately for each region. Store the
resulting CDRs for each country and the world as a vector of length two.
The CDR is defined as: \[ 
    \text{CDR} 
     =  \frac{\text{number of deaths}}{\text{number of person-years lived}}
  \] Briefly describe patterns you observe in the resulting CDRs.

\subsection{Question 5}\label{question-5}

One puzzling finding from the previous question is that the CDR for
Kenya during the period of 2005-2010 is about the same level as that for
Sweden. We would expect people in developed countries like Sweden to
have a lower death rate than those in developing countries like Kenya.
While it is simple and easy to understand, the CDR does not take into
account the age composition of a population. We therefore compute the
\emph{age specific death rate} (ASDR). The ASDR for age range
$[x, x+\delta)$ is defined as: \[
    \text{ASDR}_{[x,\ x+\delta)} 
    \ = \ \frac{\text{number of deaths for people of age $[x,\ x+\delta)$}}{\text{number of person-years of people of age $[x,\ x+\delta)$}}
  \] Calculate the ASDR for each age group, separately for Kenya and
Sweden, during the period of 2005-2010. Briefly describe the pattern you
observe.

\subsection{Question 6}\label{question-6}

One way to understand the difference in the CDR between Kenya and Sweden
is to compute the counterfactual CDR for Kenya using Sweden's population
distribution (or vice versa). This can be done by applying the following
alternative formula for the CDR. \[
    \text{CDR}
    \ = \ \text{ASDR}_{[0, 5)} \times P_{[0,5)} + \text{ASDR}_{[5, 10)}
    \times P_{[5, 10)} + \cdots 
  \] where $P_{[x, x+\delta)}$ is the proportion of the population in
the age range $[x, x+\delta)$. We compute this as the ratio of
person-years in that age range relative to the total person-years across
all age ranges. To conduct this counterfactual analysis, we use
$\text{ASDR}_{[x,x+\delta)}$ from Kenya and $P_{[x,x+\delta)}$ from
Sweden during the period of 2005--2010. That is, first calculate the
age-specific population proportions for Sweden and then use them to
compute the counterfactual CDR for Kenya. How does this counterfactual
CDR compare with the original CDR of Kenya? Briefly interpret the
result.
